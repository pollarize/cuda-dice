Hi All,
Generally i want to update the status about SW development for DICE.

Major Update:
 - I have a Release candidate of DICE Unit calculator, which is separated application with
	GPU Acceleration on  Nvidia CUDA.
	
 - I integrated CUDA Application in NodeJS (Infrastructure Application) and also 
	i have separated builds for (Win/Mac/Linux) (x64,x86) but only for NodeJS Application at
	the moment

 - I've prepared a Functional tests on CUDA Application on my GPU (Nvidia GTX 1050), after 
   statistical analysis for 100 sequential generations of units with 29 trailing zeroes (around 36.72s for 1
   Unit on my GPU) i succeed experimentally to achieve 36.37s.
   
 - Average speed on my GPU is 14 619 989.33 Operations/s (Including 2 Hashes, 1 Random Number Generation and 1 Validation per Operation)
   Raw Hashrate is around 32 MHash/s 

Conclusions:
  If we want to generate an DICE Unit with 44 trailing zeroes on my GPU, it will need 14 days to do that! The target speed for calculation of
  that unit for 4hours will be around 1 000 000 000 Op/s or 70 Card Nvidia GTX 1050.
  
  As part of development i'm looking for someone with Nvidia Graphics Card to make some test.
